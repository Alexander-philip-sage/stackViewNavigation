stackview is a common way to navigate through different pages with qt qml, but qt doesn't provide any examples for using stackview that represent good modular coding standards. Adapting what qt provides can be confusing with variable scoping problems. This example works and is recommended by developers at QT, it will show a warning in QT Creator that stackview is out of scope. This warning is innacurate.
